# Software Engineering & UX Collaboration (May 2022) - Server

This is the backend repository for the SE & UX collaboration that was undertaken at General Assembly in May 2022 over the course of two days.

- Client Demo: https://lunapark-client.netlify.app/
- Client Demo Dashboard: https://lunapark-client.netlify.app/users
- Client Repo: https://github.com/ebeecroft1/luna-park-newsletter-client

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Vue.js
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Heroku
- Netlify

A MEVN stack was chosen for the speed with which it could be built and deployed.

The server was deployed via MongoDB and Heroku.
The client was deployed via Netlify.

## Project Brief
In this hackathon style challenge, our team was challenged to create a newsletter signup form for a theme park. We selected Luna Park as our mock client.

Additional criteria were the sign up form should have error validations, the information should be saved in a backend, and an optional dashboard could be built to display the sign up information for the client.

**Day 1:**
- Backend server was built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This was then deployed via Heroku.
- Frontend client was begun using Vue.js and Bootstrap. Sign up form created.

**Day 2:**
- Frontend client deployed via Netlify and connected with deployed backend server.
- Homepage and client dashboard created.
- Styling and final polish for presentation.
